In recent years there has been an explosion of R books. However, many of these
books try to teach R and statistics simultaneously. In the list below, I've
tried to highlight books that only teach R programming.

* A first course in statistical programming with R by Braun & Murdoch. Â£20
    + Pros: I quite like this book (hence the reason I put it on my list). It
    has a nice collection of exercises, it "looks nice"" and doesn't assume
    knowledge of programming. It also doesn't assume (or try to teach) any
    statistics.
    + Cons: When describing `for()` loops and functions the examples aren't
    very statistical. For example, it uses Fibonacci sequences in the while loop
    section and the sieve of Eratosthenes for `if()` statements.
* An introduction to R by Venables \& Smith. \pounds13
    + Pros: Simple, short and to the point. Free copies available. Money from the book goes to the R project.
    + Cons: More an R reference guide than a textbook.
* A beginner's guide to R by Zuur. \pounds33
    + Pros: Assumes no prior knowledge. Proceeds through concepts slowly and
    carefully.
    + Cons: Proceeds through concepts \emph{very} slowly and carefully.
* R in a Nutshell by Adler. \pounds29
    + Pros: An excellent reference. My current favourite R book.
    + Cons: Only suitable for those with a previous (strong) computer
    background.
* Introduction to scientific programming and simulation using R by Jones,
  Maillardet and Robinson. \pounds48
    + Pros: A nice book that teaches R programming. Similar to the Braun \&
    Murdoch book.
    + Cons: A bit pricey.
